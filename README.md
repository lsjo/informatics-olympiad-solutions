# informatics-olympiad-solutions
Solutions to problems from the Australian Informatics Olympiad Website.
Note that I won't have every solution, but the ones I've uploaded here got full marks as marked by ORAC.

## UPDATE
I got into the informatics olympiad summer school (literally so excited) so now I'm going to add problem solutions from the other contests (eg AIIO, Alpha contest, FARIO) so I can prepare for those as well. I've split up the problems into folders for the contests they came from for easy searching.
